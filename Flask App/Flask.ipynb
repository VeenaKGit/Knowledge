    "2. __Flask__ : Flask is a Python web framework build with a small core and easy to extend design.\n",
    "3. Vs: \n",
    "    * Django works with Postgres, MySQL, Oracle etc. But if you want to work with NoSQL like MongoDB or No database Flask is a option.\n",
    "    * Django is a full stack framework, where as Falsk falls under a category of micro framework.\n",
    "    * Django is suitable for Large and longer time projects, while Flask is for small and shorter projects.\n",
    "    * Django is a Full Featured - meaning it is good at creating full featured web application with server side templating. Whereas Flask is more suitable for Static or RESTful web service that feeds your mobile app. \n",
    "    * Flask performs little better than Django bacause it has fewer layer.\n",
    "    * Django - Instagram, Pinterest, Udemy\n",

    "1. Web application or Web Server : This is the application written in Django or Flask sitting on some computer/server. This is the application listning on some port.\n",
    "2. Web Client : Browser acts as a web client.\n",
    "3. Resources : HTML, JSON, PDF files in the servers form resources which will be requested by the browser\n",
    "    * Static Resources : These are resources in server which doesn't change.\n",
    "    * Dynamic Resources : These are resources which are created on fly by the server when client asks for it. Example something related to time or latest posts on your fb homepage.\n",
    "4. Each resource in the application is indentified by a unique URL(Uniform Resource Locator) \n",
    "    * https://medium.com/@boscacci/why-and-how-to-make-a-requirements-txt-f329c685181e\n",
    "    * This is a example of a URL. 'https' is the protocol used '//medium.com/' this part is the name/IP address followed by the port number of the webserver. '@boscacci/why-and-how-to-make-a-requirements-txt-f329c685181e' is the path of the resource in the web server.\n",
    "    * https:\\\\www.udemy.com/spring-framework-4/?couponCode=OFFER39 -->Here '??couponCode=OFFER39' this is a query string usually in the format of name=value&name=value&...Similarly a'#' like this '?couponCode=OFFER39#/discussions' is called a fragment which is like a bookmark in the resource ( this is like a portion of the html doc which the server will show to the client). The fragment is not passed by the server. The server returns a HTML page and the browser finds the fragment in the HTML and displays it to the client.\n",

    "### HTTP, GET and POST - TODO\n",
    "1. __HTTP__ : The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers. HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.  A client (browser) submits an HTTP request to the server; then the server returns a response to the client. The response contains status information about the request and may also contain the requested content.\n",
    "2. __HTTP Methods__ : GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS\n",
    "    1. https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxiRFwQ1RJ4\n",
    "    2. __GET__:GET is used to request data/ resource from a speficied server. When we hit localhost:5000/home a GET /home resquest is sent to server. And server reponse with the home.html page\n",
    "    3. __POST__: POST is used to send data to the server for processing.\n",
    "    4. __PUT__: PUT is used to send data to the server for creating/updating a resource. In this case the PUT message will carry the required infp 'html content' to update the resouce at the server. Different between POST and PUT is that PUT is idempotent. A request method is considered \"idempotent\" if the intended effect on the server of multiple identical requests with that method is the same as the effect for a single such request. Of the request methods defined by this specification, PUT , DELETE , and SAFE request methods are idempotent. PUT puts a file or resource at a specific URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), and exactly at that URI. If there's already a file or resource at that URI, PUT replaces that file or resource. If there is no file or resource there, PUT creates one.\n",
    "    5. __HEAD__: HEAD is used to retrive only the header information of a resouce from server. Actual HTML page is not requested, only the header info of the resource is requested.  HEAD is almost identical to GET, but without the response body.\n",
    "    6. __DELETE__: DELETE is used for deleting a resource.  \n",
    "    7. __PATCH__:\n",
    "    8. __OPTIONS__:\n",
    "3. __POSTMAN Client software__ - Postman is a popular API client that makes it easy for developers to create, share, test and document APIs. This is done by allowing users to create and save simple and complex HTTP/s requests, as well as read their responses. The result - more efficient and less tedious work.\n",

    "    * https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/templates/#module-django.template\n",
    "    * the render function will take the request function as its first argument, follwed by the template name \"blog/home.html\" followed by the context (pass info to templates). --> render(request, 'blog\\home.html', context)\n",
    "    * so basically the DTL(django template language) engine does loading and rendering templates.  Loading consists of finding the template for a given identifier and preprocessing it, usually compiling it to an in-memory representation. Rendering means interpolating the template with context data and returning the resulting string. Its is important ot note that we have removed the HttpResponse here from views.py \"home\" functions, but in background \"render\" still responds with a HttpResponse. So our **Views should always needs to return either a HTTP response or a Exception.**\n",

There should rather be registration form/page on front end where user can create their accounts and login when required.\n",
