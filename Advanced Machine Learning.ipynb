This(bank transaction fraudulent) kind of problem cannot be treated as Discrete Classification because probability outcome is not directly related to decisions, it combines with other factor like if the probability of it being fraugulent is low then we need to see how much money is getting withdrawn to decised if the transaction has to be denied.\n",

    "1. MNIST Dataset: The MNIST database is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing system.\n",
    "2. Each MNIST image is of 28 * 28 = 748 pixels and each pixel value can range from 0-255 . So each image becomes a vector with 748 co-ordinates. So X is the vector and Y is the lables (0-9).\n",
    "<img src=\"images/image39.png\" align=\"middle\" style=\"width:250px; height:250px\"/>  \n",
    "3. So we find the distance between two images represented with vector of 748 using Eucledian distance.\n",
    "4. We can use k-Nearest Neighbor to classify the new image. But Eucledian distance is in general not considered as a good measuring method for Image classification, bacause with Eucledian if two images of 1'are slightly rotated, it produces big deviation in errors. So we need another method for image distance measurent which is less sensitive to rotation/trranformations\n",
    "<img src=\"images/image40.png\" align=\"middle\" style=\"width:250px; height:250px\"/> \n",
    "5. And also in general as we know kNN is really slow for large data classification as it has to look for all the 60000 images to classify a new image. So after decade study there has been diffenrent versions of kNN which address this issue.\n",
