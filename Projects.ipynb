    "1. When you do a image search say \"https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=cat\" like this one. Right click any of the image and see. You will find all over the place tags or atttrituted in HTML tags like 'jsname','jsaction', /</script/>/ etc. All those indicate that the HTML page contains lots of JavaScript and DOM (Document Object Model). Which is a first indicator that BS alone cannot be used for this kind of webscraping.\n",
    "2. You can still extract the images on that particular webpage using BS alone. I did it and it is the first version on git of ImageScraper - \"Version 1.0-lower resolution image download with BS alone\". But here is the problem. The downloaded images are of extreme low resolution (probabaly from a local google server storage which hold a low resolution copy of the image). So when you download the images source tag url (on the search page), you are not actually downloading the image from the actual website hosting the image in good resolution you are downloading it from google storage rather. __This is the first problem.__\n",
    "3. To get the original image in high resolution. Click the image once - this causes the JavaScript to open a small div on right which will actually load the image from its original website. Not right click and check the source of image. The image tag will now have the src='' which points to the actual high resolution image from teh original website. This is what we are supposed to download. But for this we will have to click the image once which is not possibel on BeautifulSoup. We would need Selenium webdriver for this task.\n",
    "4. With only BS you can download only limited low resolution images. beacuse scrolling down is down using JS. __This is the second problem.__ Check te answer below. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21006940/how-to-load-all-entries-in-an-infinite-scroll-at-once-to-parse-the-html-in-pytho.
